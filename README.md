# Deon

This is the Monstercat.com website project. Feel free to inspect and contribute.

We use vanilla JavaScript with our own tools that we have built in house. Please
browse the src directory to discover more.

Praise the sun.

## Quick Start

```
./scripts/build
```

Open the directory in your browser or use a simple web server to host.

## Building for Production

Add `pro` to the build command arguments, like this `./build pro` to build the
production version of the project. This swaps out the `env-dev.html` for the
`env-pro.html` for setting up variables.

## Contributing
